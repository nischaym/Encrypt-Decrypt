HI,

Steps to run this application<br>
1. git clone<br>
2. Move to the directory where you can see server.js<br>
3. npm install<br>
4. npm start<br>
5. The application will be available through url "http://localhost:5656"<br>
6. You can see the Public key on the console<br>
7. Enter any String you want to encrypt<br>
8. You can see the Encrypted String on the console<br>
9. You will see a success alert box once the server is done with decryption<br>
<br>
Using JSEncrypt library in the front end.<br>
As Mentioned, have used expressJS and RequireJS. <br>
Using Node RSA for key generation and decryption<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

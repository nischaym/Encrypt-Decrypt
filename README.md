HI,

Steps to run this application
1. git clone
2. Move to the directory where you can see server.js
3. npm install
4. npm start
5. The application will be available through url "http://localhost:5656"
6. You can see the Public key on the console
7. Enter any String you want to encrypt
8. You can see the Encrypted String on the console
9. You will see a success alert box once the server is done with decryption

Using JSEncrypt library in the front end
As Mentioned, have used expressJS and RequireJS. <br>
Using Node RSA key generation and decryption
